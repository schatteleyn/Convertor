PHP application. You capitalized first letter of every lines by default. You can choose by using a delimiter. Use a white space to capitalize every letter for example.
If the first character is a "special" character like an accent, it won't appear, except if the delimiter is a space.

It's under the WTFPL, so feel free to use it ! http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/
I'd be glad to receive comment, improvement or cookies !
