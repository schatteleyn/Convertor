PHP application. You capitalized first letter of every lines by default. You can choose by using a delimiter. Use a white space to capitalize every letter for example.
If a capital letter have an accent, it will be lowered, even if it's the first letter after the delimiter. Trying to solve this bug.

It's under the WTFPL, so feel free to use it ! http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/
I'd be glad to receive comment, improvement or cookies !
